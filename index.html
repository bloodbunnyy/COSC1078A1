Student number: S3708679 <br><br>
Email Address: S3708679@student.rmit.edu.au <br><br>
I am currently working as a nurse in an aged care facility. Before I became a nurse, I studied an Associate degree in Fashion Technology at RMIT.
Throughout my teenage years I was never interested in school which led me to drop out in year 10. <br>
	    The years I spent out of high school really gave me time to think about who and what I wanted to be. I began to feel inspired
	    and regained my joy for learning again. <br>
	    I have a dog, 2 cats and a rabbit, they are my children.
	My hobbies outside of studying and videogames include; patternmaking, sewing and pole dancing. </p> <br><br>

   <br> <CENTER><font color="pink"><h2> Interest in IT </h2></font></CENTER>  <br>
  
<p>Everything about computers I find absolutely fascinating. I want to learn how to code in many different 
	languages because the idea of creating a program or application from scratch is exciting to me. 
	I want to learn about all the parts inside of the computer so that I know exactly how to put together my own builds. </p>
  <br>
  <p> My interest in IT began when I was a young child. I grew up watching my older brothers play computer games on our family computer. 
  My grandfather built computers as a hobby and built me my very first personal computer when I was 7. I aspired to be just like my brothers. 
 Whatever games they played, I wanted to play. I remember back when my brother was 12, he showed me this cool new thing he was learning called HTML. 
 That made me instantly want to learn it as well. Although since I was only 7, I didn’t get very far with it. 
My only real experience with computers is just always having them and using them for personal use.
I’ve gone through about 4 personal computers in my lifetime but I still don’t know how to build them or how they really 
  work (which is why i'm in IT now). Whenever I had an issue, I got my brothers to troubleshoot it for me. 
They are now both working in the industry as web and game developers. Before this year, I had never seen IT as a career choice 
for me(mainly because my dad said it wasn't a "womens" career), but when I started to become unhappy in my current job, I had a long hard 
think about it and realised that IT had been infront of me all along and knew it would be something I’d absolutely enjoy doing.  </p> 
  <br>
  <p> I chose to study at RMIT mainly because of the location. I recently moved out to Wallan and saw it quicker 
    to get a Vline into the city then to waste money on petrol driving to another university. I also love the city life and hope
	to be able to work and move to the city in the near future.</p>
  <br>
  <p> I expect to learn everything that I am interested in through core subjects and tailoring my electives. I’d love 
    to learn how to use the raspberry pi and Arduino, I am interested in learning web development and 
    app development coding, servers and security. </p>

 <CENTER><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39599891?type=standard&searchrequesttoken=3aa1a099-81e6-4840-8d6c-3ce1e8f4308c">Link to to my Ideal Job listing</a> </CENTER>

  <p>This is a front-end developer position for an application that has been created for the child care industry. 
  What makes this position particularly interesting to me is that it is 100% remote, work from home. I will be looking for 
  work that is flexible in allowing me to travel/ live where ever I’d like and still be able to do all 
  the work required from my laptop.</p>
  <br>
<p> To able to apply for this job you need to be skilled with the following languages; HTML5, CSS3, JaveScript 
  and their relevant tools and frameworks (NPM, Yarn, Webpack, VueJS and ReactJS). You also need to be familiar with 
  the SASS/SCSS/CSS frameworks as well as working with Bootstrap. You need to understand templating languages, using GIT 
  and making code that are cross browser compatible. On top of all of this, they require you to have at least 3-5 years of 
  demonstrated experience as a front-end developer. </p>
  <br>
<p> The current skills I have would not allow me to apply for a job like this but I am hoping when I 
  finish my degree I can. The only thing I have is an office set up with reliable internet and I just started learning how 
  to use GIT. I think a lot of the desirable skills they are after such as attention to detail and problem-solving skills, 
  I’ll be able to also obtain throughout my entire degree. </p> 
  <br>
<p> My plan to obtain the required skills for a job like this one is to do well in the next 3 years of my degree and 
  finish up with my Bachelor of Information Technology. I also plan on spending time out of school to study up on other 
  programming languages to expand my language library. When it comes to picking electives at university, I am going to 
  focus on all the ones that involve more in-depth programming as well as the ones that lean more towards web development 
  as that it something I am interested in pursuing. </p>

  <br><br>
  
  <p>These results are not new to me as I have done all these tests before. I am aware that I fall under the category of INFP 
    for the Myers-Briggs personality test. Most of it is accurate but I don’t 100% agree with everything they are saying. 
    They call me an idealist which although I have some soem minimal idealistic views in my life, I see myself more as a realist. 
    I agree with the results of being 97% introverted, my ideal Saturday night consists of staying home alone with a drink and 
    playing computer games. The only issue I see coming up for me is that I am horrible with presentations and interviews due to my
     anxiety but hoping i'll be able to improve with the increased exposure gained from attending university.<br><br>
    
  When it comes to teamwork, I usually have no problem communicating with my team via online communications but when it comes to 
    group discussions, I lack input because I don’t work well with other people when face to face. 
    With my big 5 personality test it put my aggreeableness at a high percentage which makes me great in team situations as 
    I'm always open and listening to other's ideas and am never one to shut someone down.<br><br>
  
  Once I have my team formed, I would like to initially discuss what we’re going to do for the assignment then delegate 
    sections for each person to work on in their own time. I prefer that people go off and work on their own parts 
    individually but come together in the end showcasing what they have done, providing eachother feedback and then creating the final 
    assignment together. I will have to form a team with people who are more extroverted than I am to help with leading the discussion
	  progress and give me that extra push I need.<br><br>

   <br> <CENTER><font color="pink"><h2> Project Ideas </h2></font></CENTER>  <br><br><br>
  <p>For my project idea, I am interested in using the raspberry pi to create a hidden camera device that streams the 
    footage directly to your mobile phone. This will involve programming the raspberry pi using java language, 
    attaching a camera to it and once getting that to work, figuring out how to get it to send the video stream to a mobile phone. 
    I would also like to be able to have it set up in case/box so that the camera can actually be hidden and out of plain site.
  <br><br>
    I believe this product would be useful in many ways. The main reason which sparked my idea for this product in the first place, 
    is to be able to check up on your pets while you’re not at home. Whenever I’m away from home I’m always worried, thinking 
    about if my children are okay and if they’re staying out of trouble. With this project, I’d be able to check up on them at 
    any time with my mobile device even when I’m not at home, leaving me feeling at ease.
  <br><br>
    The product will come already installed, enclosed within a box that the end user will be able to put anywhere they like within 
their home. The user will then download an application on their mobile phone and connect to the device via a cable for initial setup. 
 Once the setup is complete, the device will be connected to the home wireless internet network and be ready for use. 
 The user will then be able to go into their application in order to activate the device and view what the device is currently 
 recording. The device will also intermittently take photos throughout the day that the user can check on later in their 
 own time. The photos will be stored locally on a USB drive connected to the raspberry pi (1 will be shipped with the device). 
The user will be able to activate motion detection if they wish, which will be recording if there is motion detected. 
  The app will allow the user to access multiple cameras in their home and will also have access to some functionality that 
  will allow them to zoom in and out. In order to deliver these services to the app, the device will run on a server that 
 connects to the internet to allow the user to get a video feed with very minimal delay wherever they may be in the world 
 (if they have some sort of internet connection). The device will have 2 primary cameras, one being a regular camera and 
the other one, an infrared camera. This will allow the device to function even if it is in a dark place i.e. it is late at 
 night or the camera is just stationed in a dark room or space such as inside a safe.
The smart device application will feature a simple interface that allows the user to easily switch between cameras 
and view past photos or videos. It will also have the ability to share photos and videos taken onto the user’s social 
media accounts if they wish.
The design of the box/case that it comes in will be subtle as to fit in with other things the user might have stored near it. 
It will also be designed in a way to allow as wide a view as possible as to limit the amount of dead space in the area.

    <br><br>
    To create my project, I will first need to purchase a raspberry pi. Since I haven’t used one before I will have to do my 
    research and watch videos to learn how they work and how to operate them. I will need to purchase a camera of some sorts, 
    preferably a something small so that I can make it a hidden camera but if I can’t find anything similar, I could use a web cam. 
    I already know some java basics but would have to study up to be able to write program for my idea to function. I would also have 
    to figure out how to be able to get the feed from the camera to be sent directly to my phone. I would have to investigate this, 
    maybe there is an app I can already use, or I may have to create my own, or maybe I could just get it to work by the camera taking 
    short recordings and sending them via cloud to my phone. I don’t think it will be a very hard project to achieve as I know the 
    raspberry pi already has a slot to attach a camera, it’s just about figuring out how everything else will come together to bring my 
    idea to life. 
    <br><br>
    If the project is successful, you should be able to set it up anywhere in your home and connect it up to your Wifi. 
    Once turned on, the device should then be able to live record its surroundings, sending a direct feed 
    to your mobile device. I think this project will be very useful to me and others as purchasing surveillance cameras that can be viewed
    via your phone currently are quite expensive. By creating my own using the raspberry pi, it will not only be a fun project, it 
    will be a lot more affordable. With this device you’ll be able to check up on your pets, see when your food is finished cooking 
    from another room, be able to check up on carers/babysitters to make sure they’re doing their job correctly or it can even be 
    placed at your front door so you can see if there is any suspicious activity happening around your home when you’re not there.
