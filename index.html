  <h3> Personal Information </h3> <br>
 <p> Name: Jessica Ryan <br>
Student number: S3708679 <br>
Email Address: S3708679@student.rmit.edu.au <br>
I am currently working as a nurse in an aged care home, before that I was studying an Associate degree in Fashion Technology at RMIT.
I was never interested in learning and school while in high school and dropped out in year 10. 
After I left, I figured out that I actually enjoyed learning when it was something I was interested in.
   My hobbies outside of studying and videogames include; patternmaking, sewing and pole dancing. </p>
  
  
   <br> <h3> Interest in IT </h3> <br>
  
<p>I am interested in how computers and everything to do with this great technology works. I want to learn how 
   to code in many different languages because the idea of creating a program or application from scratch is exciting to me. 
    I want to learn about all the parts inside the computer so I know exactly how to put together my own builds. </p>
  <br>
  <p> My interest in IT began when I was a child, I grew up watching my older brothers play computer games on our family computer. 
  My grandfather built computers as a hobby and built me my very first personal computer when I was 7. I aspired to be like my brothers, 
  whatever games they played I wanted to play. I remember when my brother was 12 he started learning this cool thing called HTML, 
  I instantly wanted to learn that as well. Although being 7 I didn’t get very far with it. My experience with computers is just growing up
  with them, I’ve gone through about 4 personal computers in my lifetime but I still don’t know how to build them or how they really 
  work, whenever I had an issue I got my brothers to troubleshoot it for me. They are now both working in the industry as a 
  web developer and game developer. I have never before seen it as a career choice for me but when I started to become unhappy 
  in my current job I had a long think about it and realised IT has been infront of me all along and would be something I’d 
    absolutely enjoy doing.  </p> 
  <br>
  <p> I chose to study at RMIT mainly because of the location. I recently moved out north and saw it quicker 
    to get a Vline into the city then to waste money on petrol driving to another university. </p>
  <br>
  <p> I expect to learn everything that I am interested in through core subjects and tailoring my electives. I’d love 
    to learn how to use the raspberry pi and Arduino, I am interested in learning web development and 
    app development coding, servers and security. </p>
  
  
   <br> <h3> Ideal Job </h3> <br>
 <a href "https://www.seek.com.au/job/39599891?type=standard&searchrequesttoken=3aa1a099-81e6-4840-8d6c-3ce1e8f4308c"> 
  Link to to my Ideal Job listing</a>
<p>This is a front-end developer position for an application that has been created for the child care industry. 
  What makes this position particularly interesting to me is that it is 100% remote, work from home. I will be looking for 
  work that is flexible in allowing me to travel/ live where ever I’d like and still be able to do all 
  the work required from my laptop.</p>
  <br>
<p> To able to apply for this job you need to be skilled with the following languages; HTML5, CSS3, JaveScript 
  and their relevant tools and frameworks (NPM, Yarn, Webpack, VueJS and ReactJS). You also need to be familiar with 
  the SASS/SCSS/CSS frameworks as well as working with Bootstrap. You need to understand templating languages, using GIT 
  and making code that are cross browser compatible. On top of all of this, they require you to have at least 3-5 years of 
  demonstrated experience as a front-end developer. </p>
  <br>
<p> The current skills I have would not allow me to apply for a job like this but I am hoping when I 
  finish my degree I can. The only thing I have is an office set up with reliable internet and I just started learning how 
  to use GIT. I think a lot of the desirable skills they are after such as attention to detail and problem-solving skills, 
  I’ll be able to also obtain throughout my entire degree. </p> 
  <br>
<p> My plan to obtain the required skills for a job like this one is to do well in the next 3 years of my degree and 
  finish up with my Bachelor of Information Technology. I also plan on spending time out of school to study up on other 
  programming languages to expand my language library. When it comes to picking electives at university, I am going to 
  focus on all the ones that involve more in-depth programming as well as the ones that lean more towards web development 
  as that it something I am interested in pursuing. </p>
