Student number: S3708679 <br><br>
Email Address: S3708679@student.rmit.edu.au <br><br>
I am currently working as a nurse in an aged care home, before that I was studying an Associate degree in Fashion Technology at RMIT.
I was never interested in learning and school while in high school and dropped out in year 10. <br>
After I left, I figured out that I actually enjoyed learning when it was something I was interested in.
   My hobbies outside of studying and videogames include; patternmaking, sewing and pole dancing. </p> <br><br>

   <br> <CENTER><font color="pink"><h2> Interest in IT </h2></font></CENTER>  <br>
  
<p>I am interested in how computers and everything to do with this great technology works. I want to learn how 
   to code in many different languages because the idea of creating a program or application from scratch is exciting to me. 
    I want to learn about all the parts inside the computer so I know exactly how to put together my own builds. </p>
  <br>
  <p> My interest in IT began when I was a child, I grew up watching my older brothers play computer games on our family computer. 
  My grandfather built computers as a hobby and built me my very first personal computer when I was 7. I aspired to be like my brothers, 
  whatever games they played I wanted to play. I remember when my brother was 12 he started learning this cool thing called HTML, 
  I instantly wanted to learn that as well. Although being 7 I didn’t get very far with it. My experience with computers is just growing up
  with them, I’ve gone through about 4 personal computers in my lifetime but I still don’t know how to build them or how they really 
  work, whenever I had an issue I got my brothers to troubleshoot it for me. They are now both working in the industry as a 
  web developer and game developer. I have never before seen it as a career choice for me but when I started to become unhappy 
  in my current job I had a long think about it and realised IT has been infront of me all along and would be something I’d 
    absolutely enjoy doing.  </p> 
  <br>
  <p> I chose to study at RMIT mainly because of the location. I recently moved out north and saw it quicker 
    to get a Vline into the city then to waste money on petrol driving to another university. </p>
  <br>
  <p> I expect to learn everything that I am interested in through core subjects and tailoring my electives. I’d love 
    to learn how to use the raspberry pi and Arduino, I am interested in learning web development and 
    app development coding, servers and security. </p>

  <p>This is a front-end developer position for an application that has been created for the child care industry. 
  What makes this position particularly interesting to me is that it is 100% remote, work from home. I will be looking for 
  work that is flexible in allowing me to travel/ live where ever I’d like and still be able to do all 
  the work required from my laptop.</p>
  <br>
<p> To able to apply for this job you need to be skilled with the following languages; HTML5, CSS3, JaveScript 
  and their relevant tools and frameworks (NPM, Yarn, Webpack, VueJS and ReactJS). You also need to be familiar with 
  the SASS/SCSS/CSS frameworks as well as working with Bootstrap. You need to understand templating languages, using GIT 
  and making code that are cross browser compatible. On top of all of this, they require you to have at least 3-5 years of 
  demonstrated experience as a front-end developer. </p>
  <br>
<p> The current skills I have would not allow me to apply for a job like this but I am hoping when I 
  finish my degree I can. The only thing I have is an office set up with reliable internet and I just started learning how 
  to use GIT. I think a lot of the desirable skills they are after such as attention to detail and problem-solving skills, 
  I’ll be able to also obtain throughout my entire degree. </p> 
  <br>
<p> My plan to obtain the required skills for a job like this one is to do well in the next 3 years of my degree and 
  finish up with my Bachelor of Information Technology. I also plan on spending time out of school to study up on other 
  programming languages to expand my language library. When it comes to picking electives at university, I am going to 
  focus on all the ones that involve more in-depth programming as well as the ones that lean more towards web development 
  as that it something I am interested in pursuing. </p>

  <br><br>
  
  <p>These results are not new to me as I have done all these tests before. I am aware that I fall under the category of INFP 
    for the Myers-Briggs personality test. Most of it is accurate but I don’t agree with everything they are saying. 
    They call me an idealist which although I have some idealistic aspects in my life, I see myself more as a realist. 
    I agree with the results of being 97% introverted, my ideal Saturday night consists of staying home alone with a drink and 
    playing computer games.<br><br>
    
  When it comes to teamwork, I usually have no problem communicating with my team via online communications but when it comes to 
    group discussions, I lack input because I don’t work well with other people when face to face. 
    With my big 5 personality test it put my aggreeableness at a high percentage which makes me great in team situations as 
    I'm always open and listening to other's ideas and am never one to shut someone down.<br><br>
  
  Once I have my team formed, I would like to initially discuss what we’re going to do for the assignment then delegate 
    sections for each person to work on in their own time. I prefer that people go off and work on their own parts 
    individually but come together in the end showcasing what they have done, provide feedback and then create the final 
    assignment together.<br><br>

   <br> <CENTER><font color="pink"><h2> Project Ideas </h2></font></CENTER>  <br><br><br>
  <p>For my project idea, I am interested in using the raspberry pi to create a hidden camera device that streams the 
    footage directly to your mobile phone. This will involve programming the raspberry pi using java language, 
    attaching a camera to it and once getting that to work, figuring out how to get it to send the video stream to a mobile phone. 
    I would also like to be able to have it set up in case/box so that the camera can well and truly be hidden and so that the 
    product can just be placed on a shelf and no one is the wiser.
  <br><br>
    I believe this product would be useful in many ways. The main reason which sparked my idea for this product in the first place, 
    is to be able to check up on your pets while you’re not at home. Whenever I’m away from home I’m just thinking about if my 
    fur babies are okay and if they’re staying out of trouble. With this device I’d be able to feel at ease with being able to 
    check on them at any time with my mobile phone even though I’m not at home.
  <br><br>
    ADD DESCRIPTION HERE
    <br><br>
    To create my project, I will first need to purchase a raspberry pi. Since I haven’t used one before I will have to do my 
    research and watch videos to learn how they work and how to operate them. I will need to purchase a camera of some sorts, 
    preferably a something small so that I can make it a hidden camera but if I can’t find anything similar, I could use a web cam. 
    I already know some java basics but would have to study up to be able to write program for my idea to function. I would also have 
    to figure out how to be able to get the feed from the camera to be sent directly to my phone. I would have to investigate this, 
    maybe there is an app I can already use, or I may have to create my own, or I maybe I could just get it to work by the camera taking 
    short recordings and sending them via cloud to my phone. I don’t think it will be a very hard project to achieve as I know the 
    raspberry pi already has a slot to attach a camera, it’s just about figuring out how everything else will come together to bring my 
    idea to life. 
    <br><br>
    If the project is successful, so if it works exactly according to plan without any hiccups, you should be able to set it up 
    anywhere in your home. Once turned on, the device should then be able to live record it’s surrounds sending you a direct feed 
    to your mobile device. I think this project will be very useful to me and others as purchasing cameras that you can view from your 
    hone currently are quite expensive, so by creating my own using the raspberry pi, it will be a lot more affordable. With this 
    device you’ll be able to check up on your pets, see when your food is finished cooking from another room, be able to check up on 
    carers/babysitters to make sure they’re doing their job correctly or it can be placed at your front door so you can see if there
    is any suspicious activity happening around your home when you’re not there.
